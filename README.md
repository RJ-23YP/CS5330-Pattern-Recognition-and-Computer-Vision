Introduces the fundamentals of extracting information from digital images. Major topics include image formation and acquisition, gray-scale and color image processing, image filters, feature detection, texture, object segmentation, classification, recognition, stereo, optical flow, motion estimation, and object detection and recognition. The course will cover both classical and modern computer vision techniques built on deep networks.

Students will learn by developing small and medium-scale vision systems to solve practical problems such as image filtering, content-based image retrieval, image stitching, augmented reality, and object recognition.
