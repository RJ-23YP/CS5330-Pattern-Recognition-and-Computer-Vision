# Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision

This course introduces the fundamentals of extracting information from digital images. Major topics include image formation and acquisition, gray-scale and color image processing, image filters, feature detection, texture, object segmentation, classification, recognition, stereo, optical flow, motion estimation, and object detection and recognition. The course covers both classical and modern computer vision techniques built on deep networks.

Projects involve developing small and medium-scale vision systems to solve practical problems such as image filtering, content-based image retrieval, image stitching, augmented reality, and object recognition.

Broadly, these are the activities covered in this course:
1. The fundamentals of image formation and image acquisition, including camera calibration.
2. Image processing algorithms such as filtering, morphological operations, connected components, and feature detection.
3. Algorithms for segmentation, detection, tracking, and classification of objects.
4. Implementation of computer vision systems using deep networks to solve computer vision tasks such as object recognition and localization.
5. Work in groups to design and develop a medium-sized image analysis and computer vision application.
6. Present algorithms and results in an organized and competent manner, both written and oral.

Programming Languages: C++, Python

Libraries: OpenCV
