Introduces the fundamentals of extracting information from digital images. Major topics include image formation and acquisition, gray-scale and color image processing, image filters, feature detection, texture, object segmentation, classification, recognition, stereo, optical flow, motion estimation, and object detection and recognition. The course will cover both classical and modern computer vision techniques built on deep networks.

Students will learn by developing small and medium-scale vision systems to solve practical problems such as image filtering, content-based image retrieval, image stitching, augmented reality, and object recognition.

Broadly, these are the topics covered in this course:
1. Students understand the fundamentals of image formation and image acquisition, including camera calibration.
2. Students understand and can implement image processing algorithms such as filtering, morphological operations, connected components, and feature detection.
3. Students understand and can implement algorithms for segmentation, detection, tracking, and classification of objects.
4. Students understand and can implement systems using deep networks to solve computer vision tasks such as object recognition and localization.
5. Students work in a group to design and develop a medium-sized image analysis and computer vision application.
6. Students present algorithms and results in an organized and competent manner, both written and orally.
